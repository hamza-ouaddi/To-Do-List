# To-Do-List

This is a small "To Do List" project which is a website that has 2 sections "To buy list" and "To work list". To buy list shows the current date and you can add the things that you want to buy. To work list is for the tasks that you have in your day.


I used EJS in this project to generate HTML markup without using many HTML pages, it's like a template that you can use it and replace the content using JavaScript. In addition, I used Node.js with express.js for the back-end, it was almost challenging and fun at the same time. There will be more features in this project in the future during the learning path.
