# To-Do-List

This is a small "To Do List" project which is a website that has 2 sections "To buy list" and "To work list". To buy list shows the current date and you can add the things that you want to buy. To work list is for the tasks that you have in your day.


I used EJS in this project to generate HTML markup without using many HTML pages, it's like a template that you can use it and replace the content using JavaScript. In addition, I used Node.js with express.js for the back-end, it was almost challenging and fun at the same time. There will be more features in this project in the future during the learning path.

## New Update [04/08/2023]


I updated the project by adding a database to it using MongoDB with Mongoose. The website is built by EJS, Javascript, and Node.js with Express.js. Now the users are able to delete the items from the list, as well as create new lists with different titles. Moreover, if the users typed the same title of a previous list, they can reach the previous list with its items.

The new website: [To Do List](https://to-do-list-4fft.onrender.com/)
